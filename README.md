This is a game called spaceshooter. This was my frist game it has flip stereo, music, a shop to buy and upgrade weapons. After download unpack and read the readme.txt. Requires DirectX 7

i saw that some guys not know the controls well:

'arrowkeys' for moving a round

'enter' to enter shop realy cool!!

'ecs' to quit

'spacebar' to launch nuke (if you have one)

'ctrl' to shoot with cannons
